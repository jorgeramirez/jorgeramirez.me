# Personal website

This repository contains the source code of my [website](http://jramirez.me/), created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and based on this [awesome template](https://github.com/surudhb/gatsby-personal-site-template) (which I adapted to Gatsby V5.)


## Development

Run the site locally.
```
gatsby develop
```

Deploy

```
npm run deploy
```
