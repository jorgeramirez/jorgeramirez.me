            , Italy. My current research interest is broadly in human computation and crowdsourcing for collecting
            high-quality data, with potential applications in machine learning. My thesis work focuses on developing
            strategies for addressing performance concerns and bias in designing, running, and reporting crowdsourcing
            experiments (helping crowd workers, the overall task design, and task requesters).

            Before starting my Ph.D., I worked for six years as a software engineer (2012-2017). From 2016 to 2017, I
            worked full-time as a lead software engineer at my own company, which I co-founded with my university
            classmates back in 2013 (initially as a side hustle, but it's been growing :) I hold a bachelor's in
            computer science from the Polytechnic Faculty of the National University of Asuncion (
            <a href="https://www.pol.una.py/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Facultad Polit√©nica, UNA
            </a>
            ). Unlike typical 4-years bachelor programs, this is a rather monolithic 5-years (+1 for thesis) program in
            computer science (the exact name, Informatics Engineering).

          <p className="i-5">
            In my spare time, I like to run, play football/soccer, and breakdance (yes, bboying, I used to do cool
            tricks back in the day ;)
